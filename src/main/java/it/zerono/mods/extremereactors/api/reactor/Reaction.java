/**
 * This is the reaction of 1 unit of source Reactant to 1 unit of product Reactant.
 * Floating-point quantities will be used, so this registration
 * is for a Unit Reaction of 1 unit of reactant to 1 unit of product.
 *
 * Reactivity:
 *  An exponent applied to the number of fission events to determine the base amount of radiation created.
 *  Raising this produces more radiation per fuel unit.
 *
 * Fission rate:
 *  How fast this reaction occurs. Each tick, the reactor will multiply this number by the amount of source
 *  reactant to determine how much source reactant actually reacts.
 *  Raising this will cause the reactor to burn this reactant faster.
